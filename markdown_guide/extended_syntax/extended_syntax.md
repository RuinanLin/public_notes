Here's a simple footnote,[^1] and here's a longer one.[^bignote]

[^bignote]: Here's one with multiple paragraphs and code.

	Indent paragraphs to include them in the footnote.

	`{ my code }`

	Add as many paragraphs as you like.

### My Great Heading {#custom-id}[^2]

[A link to custom ID](#custom-id)

[^2]: As you can see, github does not support custom IDs. IDs are auto-generated only. When you write `## My Section`, it will automatically generate an ID like `my-section`, and we can link to it using `[Go to section](#my-section)`

First Term
: This is the definition of the first item.

Second Term
: This is one definition of the second item.
: This is another definition of the second item.[^3]

[^3]: As you can see, Github Flavored Markdown (GFM) does not support definition lists.

~~The world is flat.~~ We now know that the world is round.
