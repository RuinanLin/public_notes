## toggle

toggle: 切换

(Practical Vim - Chapter 6 - Tip 36 - Meet the Buffer List)

The % symbol indicates which of the buffers is visible in the current window, while the # symbol represents the alternate file. We can quickly ***toggle*** between the current and alternate files by pressing <C-^> . Press it once, and we’ll switch to a.txt; press it a second time, and we’ll get back to b.txt.

## crude

crude: 粗糙的

(Practical Vim - Chapter 6 - Tip 37)

Compared to the listing provided by the :ls command, the output from running :args looks ***crude***. It should come as no surprise to learn that the argument list was a feature of vi, whereas the buffer list is an enhancement introduced by Vim. But give the argument list a chance, and you’ll see that it makes a fine complement to the buffer list.

---

## populate

populate: 填充

(Practical Vim - Chapter 6 - Tip 37 - Specify Files by Name)

The simplest way of ***populating*** the argument list is by specifying filenames one by one.

---

## backtick

backtick: 反引号

(Practical Vim - Chapter 6 - Tip 37 - Specify Files by Backtick Expansion)

Vim executes the text inside the ***backtick*** characters in the shell, using the output from the cat command as the argument for the :args command. Here, we’ve used the cat command to get the contents of the .chapters file, but we could use any command that’s available in the shell.

---

## concil

concil: 调解

(Practical Vim - Chapter 6 - Tip 38 - Handle Hidden Buffers on Quit)

If we want to keep the changes, we can run :write to save the buffer to a file. Or if we want to discard the changes, we can instead run :edit!, which rereads the file from disk, overwriting the contents of the buffer. Having ***reconciled*** the contents of the buffer with the file on disk, we can try the :quit command again.

## nag, nuisance

nag: 唠叨
nuisance: 滋扰

(Practical Vim - Chapter 6 - Tip 38 - Enable the 'hidden' Setting Before Running ':argdo' or ':bufdo')

By default, Vim prevents us from abandoning a modified buffer. Whether we use the :next!, :bnext!, :cnext!, or any similar command, if we omit the trailing bang symbol, Vim will ***nag*** us with the “No write since last change” error message. In most cases, this message is a useful reminder. But in one scenario it becomes a ***nuisance***.

---

## eyeball

eyeball: 仔细检查

(Practical Vim - Chapter 6 - Tip 38 - Enable the 'hidden' Setting Before Running ':argdo' or ':bufdo')

After running :argdo {cmd}, we’ll want to save the changes that were made to each item in the argument list. We could do it one at a time by running :first and then :wn, which would give us the opportunity to ***eyeball*** each file. Or if we’re confident that everything is in order, we could run :argdo write (or :wall) to save all buffers.

## out of the blue

out of the blue: 出乎意料地

(Practical Vim - Chapter 6 - Tip 40 - How to Use Tabs)

Suppose that we’re at work on a project, with our workspace divided into a few split windows. ***Out of the blue***, something urgent comes up and we have to switch contexts. Rather than opening new files in our current tab page, which would mess up our carefully assembled workspace, we can create a new tab page and do the work there.

---

## obtrusive

obtrusive: 突兀的

(https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)

Depending on the application you use, you may not be able to preview the formatted document in real time. But that’s okay. According to Gruber, Markdown syntax is designed to be readable and ***unobtrusive***, so the text in Markdown files can be read even if it isn’t rendered.

---

## virtually, stark

virtually: 几乎
stark: 鲜明的

(https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)

Markdown is portable. Files containing Markdown-formatted text can be opened using ***virtually*** any application. If you decide you don’t like the Markdown application you’re currently using, you can import your Markdown files into another Markdown application. That’s in ***stark*** contrast to word processing applications like Microsoft Word that lock your content into a proprietary file format.

---

## future proof, indefinitely

future proof: 面向未来的
indefinitely: 无限期地

(https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)

Markdown is ***future proof***. Even if the application you’re using stops working at some point in the future, you’ll still be able to read your Markdown-formatted text using a text editing application. This is an important consideration when it comes to books, university theses, and other milestone documents that need to be preserved ***indefinitely***.

## kick the tires

The phrase "kick the tires" is an idiom that comes from the old habit of literally kicking the tires of a car to test if they were firm before buying or driving it. It means "to try something out to see if it works as expected".

## (someone's) cup of tea

(someone's) cup of tea: 是我的菜，合我的胃口

(https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)

If you’re familiar with HTML, CSS, and version control, check out Jekyll, a popular static site generator that takes Markdown files and builds an HTML website. One advantage to this approach is that GitHub Pages provides free hosting for Jekyll-generated websites. If Jekyll isn’t ***your cup of tea***, just pick one of the many other static site generators available.

## get the hang of

get the hang of: 掌握窍门

(https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)

Believe it or not, you can generate presentations from Markdown-formatted files. Creating presentations in Markdown takes a little getting used to, but once you ***get the hang of*** it, it’s a lot faster and easier than using an application like PowerPoint or Keynote.

---

## practically
practically: 几乎

(https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)

One of the most confusing aspects of using Markdown is that ***practically*** every Markdown application implements a slightly different version of Markdown. These variants of Markdown are commonly referred to as flavors. It’s your job to master whatever flavor of Markdown your application has implemented.

---

## discrepancy

discrepancy: 差异

(https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

Nearly all Markdown applications support the basic syntax outlined in the original Markdown design document. There are minor variations and ***discrepancies*** between Markdown processors — those are noted inline wherever possible.

---

## quarterly, revenue

quarterly: 季度的
revenue: 收入

(https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

The ***quarterly*** results look great! ***Revenue*** was off the chart. Profits were higher than ever. Everything is going according to plan.

---

## punctuation

punctuation: 标点

(https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

Although not required, you can include a space between the first and second set of brackets. The label in the second set of brackets is not case sensitive and can include letters, numbers, spaces, or ***punctuation***.
