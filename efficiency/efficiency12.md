# Efficiency 12 - Comment Out a Block of Code in Vim

## Author: Ruinan Lin
## Date: Feb 10, 2026

We use Visual Block:

1. `Ctrl + v`;
2. Select the headings of each line you wish to comment out;
3. `I`;
4. Insert `//` (Note that in Insert mode, it will only display the modification of the first line you've selected);
5. Exit Insert mode (You will see the entire visual block commented out).
